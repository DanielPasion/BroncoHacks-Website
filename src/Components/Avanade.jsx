        The BroncoHacks committee assisted Avanade in Spring 2024 with bringing
        AI For a Better Future to life at Cal Poly Pomona. The committee was
        assigned the task of increasing the attendance for students, acting as a
        liason among the students at CPP and the workers for the company. We
        were able to give advice to Avanade for what to include in their
        hackathon. We also planned a social event for people to learn about what
        a hackathon is and form teams as well indepently.
