        Mini Hack is targeted towards incoming students who have never coded
        outside of the classroom before. The goal of "minihacks" are to have all
        of the hackers complete a task before leaving the hackathon.{" "}
        <b>
          In 2023, this was utilizing the new OpenAI API, to create a python
          chatbot that would be able to remember past conversations. In 2024,
          this was having the teams come up with an app idea utilizing the
          spoonacular Food API.
        </b>{" "}
        Students who attended this MiniHack were provided resource material on
        the basics of python, basics of calling an API, and the basics of
        starting a web page. With the help of the BroncoHacks Staff, the
        majority of the participants were able to complete the task.
